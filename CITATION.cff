title: "Digital Stratification: The Emergence of Educational Apartheid in the Global Knowledge Economy"
abstract: >
  The global knowledge economy has created a new form of educational segregation: 
  "digital stratification"â€”the systematic divergence between STEM and humanities 
  education across continental regions. Our novel Balance Index quantifies 
  educational equilibrium, revealing unprecedented disparities with profound 
  implications for democracy and social cohesion.
